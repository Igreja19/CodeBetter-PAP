## Warning

- Outside the readme, reports will be found where the language corresponds to the Portuguese language.
- This project was carried out as the last project of a three-year programming course and is still under development.
- This project has some bugs, and some features that have not yet been implemented, that is, they do not work remembering that this project is still under development.
- This project used some codepen projects to demonstrate the website's functionality, the credits were also kept in each person's code



## Introduction

The Professional Aptitude Test that I chose to carry out is a project whose objective is the realization of a code community for users with the basic level of programming at the web level.
I chose this project because it is an area that fascinates me and that I personally like a lot.
The Project has as main objective the development of a code editor at the web level where the user can edit the code and observe the final result in real time, as well as the development of a community where there is the sharing of created projects and also the storage of projects categorized as public or private.
Starting with the code editor, I wanted it to contain 3 languages ​​(HTML, CSS and JS) allowing to create programming projects at the web level and being able to save the projects. In the community part, it would be the storage and demonstration of all projects classified as thus making it possible for other users to view, edit and modify the code.
With my project, I intended to reach an active community of web developers and I intend to use various tools that were taught to me.




## Concept

The idea came up with the aim of helping the user to develop front-end code, being able to observe, develop and edit projects in a more user friendly way.
 As a user of several code communities, which have provided me with constant learning. The idea came up to create a project that would be a facilitator for the creation of new projects in relation to front-end code.
 This application allows users not only to create front-end content but also to share with other users what has been developed.
 In addition to the main objective that would be to create front-end projects it also contains a system that allows the total customization of the website that the user may or may not implement, it is also intended to create a community by making the projects public among users desirable .

When clicking on the button to create a project, the user is asked to enter a name for the project, after that, they are redirected to a page where they can develop, edit and observe their project in real time with the Save as Public options, that is, when clicking in the button the project is added to a community where other users will be able to see the code created, Save as Private where a different plan is needed from the free plan to be able to be used, a button to be able to see the project better and another to exit the edition of the project.</p>

## TargetAudience

Since my project is a means of developing projects at the online level containing some programming languages ​​related to the web, the target audience of my project are all users of any age with a beginner level of programming at the front-end level, who need a platform of tools that can be used in the development of projects linked to websites. The figures below represent the searches carried out on Google Trends on the languages ​​at the web level that my project will contain.
